The output is paginated if too long. This is done if there are more than
3 rules which can be implied from the input text. In this case the output
will be at first ``[{'pages': __NPAGES__}]``, where __NPAGES__ is the
number of pages (i.e. the ceil of the number of rules divided by 3).
The user will then write "next page" and you will give the normal output,
but with only rules 1 to 3. The user will then write "next page" and you will
give the normal output, with rules 4 to 6. This will be repeated until
all rules have been output.
