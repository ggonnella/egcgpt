intro1: "Be sure to always respect the following rules:"
level: |
       If: <ReferenceValue> is unspecific, e.g. "high" or "low"
       Then: <Operator> is "$"
presence: |
          If: <AttributeMode> 'presence'
          Then: <Operator> is "=="; <ReferenceValue> is either "True" or "False"
one_unit_no_array: |
                   If: the rule applies for one <Unit>
                   Then: the entry 'unit_name' contains a string key
                   If: the rule applies to multiple <Unit>s
                   Then: The entry 'unit_name' contains an array of strings (unit names)
region_whole_genome: |
                     Rule: use a '.' to represent <AttributeRegion> whole region
                     NO: {'genomic_region': 'whole genome'}
                     OK: {'genomic_region': '.'}
nodot: |
       If: group_name or group_type or attribute_mode or operator or reference or reference_type is '.'
       Then: add to the dictionary describing the expectation the entry 'valid_output': False
svc_multiunits: |
                If for multiple units the same expectation can be extracted from the text
                (everything equal except for the unit name), then only define one record
                and give the unit names as an array instead of a string.
hint_vrule_presence: |
                     If the Attribute.Mode is 'presence', the Operator can only be '==' and the value either 'True' or 'False'.
                     Attribute.Mode 'presence'it should be used in V lines, and always used instead of Attribute.Mode 'count' or 'relative_frequency'
                     whenever the Value would be 0. Also use 'presence' if the text does not mention a number,
                     e.g. when it just mentions that something is present or absent.
hint_crule_presence: |
                     The Attribute.Mode 'presence' is not allowed in C lines.
