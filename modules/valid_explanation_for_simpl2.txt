"valid":
  an assessment if the following 16 conditions:
    (1) __GROUPNAME__ is not "." and not empty
    (2) __UNITNAME__ is not "." and not empty
    (3) __GROUPTYPE__ is one of the 8 group types mentioned above
    (4) __UNITTYPE__ is one of the 13 unit types mentioned above
    (5) __MODE__ is one of the 3 modes mentioned above
    (6) __COMPARISONOPERATOR__ is one of the 14 operators mentioned above
    (7) __REFERENCETYPE__ is either "group" or "value"
    (8) if __REFERENCETYPE__ is "group", then __REFERENCEDATA__ is a group name
    (9) if __REFERENCETYPE__ is "value", then __REFERENCEDATA__ is a numeric value,
        a range of values, a boolean or a word expressing a quantitative level;
        __REFERENCEDATA__ is not another kind of word
    (10) if __MODE__ is "presence", then __REFERENCETYPE__ is "value",
        the operator is "==" and __REFERENCEVALUE__ is either "True" or "False"
    (11) if __MODE__ is "count" or "length", then __REFERENCEVALUE__s
         is not a boolean
    (12) if __COMPARISONOPERATOR__ is "<>" or "><", then __REFERENCETYPE__ is "value"
         and __REFERENCEVALUE__ is a pair of numeric values expressing the range limits
    (13) if __COMPARISONOPERATOR__ is not "<>" or "><",
         then __REFERENCEVALUE__ is not a pair of numeric values
    (14) if __COMPARISONOPERATOR__ is "$", then __REFERENCETYPE__ is "value" and
         then __REFERENCEVALUE__ is a word expressing quantitative level, such as
         high or low
    (15) if __COMPARISONOPERATOR__ is not "$", then __REFERENCEVALUE__ is not a word expressing 
         a quantitative level
    (16) __REASON__ is concise and does not contain formulations suchg as "in the text",
    "in the input text", "the text implies that" or similar
  __VALID__ is an array of 16 "true" or "false" values.
  Check each of the conditions above and use "true" in __VALID__ for it, if and only
  if the condition is true, and "false" otherwise. Your goal is that "rule"
    shall be so formulated that "valid" contains only "true" values, but
    the assessment of valid is very important
  and shall always be earnest.
