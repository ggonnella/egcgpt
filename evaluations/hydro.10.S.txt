S	SH12	PMID:30768760	Unlike cultivated Nanoarchaeota, however, the Gua-46 MAG contains a predicted tyrosine-specific transporter (Gua_114), which may allow the nanoarchaeote to uptake this amino acid from the environment. The MC-1 MAG also encodes for genes involved in nucleotide biotransformation that have not been previously identified in cultivated nanoarchaeotes, including a cytidylate kinase (MC-1_488) and a uridylate kinase (MC-1_320).
S	SH31	PMID:25124552	The lack of Mtr and the other genes of the CO2-reductive pathway in the three Methanomassiliicoccales described here, prompted us to reevaluate the overall methanogenesis markers. In addition to the five genes coding for subunits of the Mtr enzymatic complex, two former methanogenesis markers (annotated as methanogenesis markers 10 and 14 in the databases and belonging to arCOG00950 and arCOG04866, respectively) are absent from the three Methanomassiliicoccales genomes (Table 5).
S	SH4	PMID:25133584	The genome harbors pyrophosphate-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) and proton-translocating pyrophosphatase, which have been identified in methanotrophic and thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria
S	SH51	PMID:20597983	Although sulfur-oxidizing members of the Gammaproteobacteria have been isolated frequently from vent sites, our knowledge of their sulfur-oxidation pathways is rather limited. Some strains, for example Thiomicrospira crunogena XCL-2, seem to use the complete Sox enzyme system (Scott et al., 2006), while others such as Beggiatoa and the endosymbiont of the tubeworm R. pachyptila use alternative pathways (Hagen & Nelson, 1997; Markert et al., 2007). The huge variety of gammaproteobacterial aprA genes found in this study indicates that Gammaproteobacteria at the Irina II site mainly use the APS pathway for sulfur oxidation.
S	SH58	PMID:17105352	A recent comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the cytochrome c553 proteins, including the mono-heme cytochromes from Thiom. crunogena and Thiob. denitrificans, revealed existence of a large protein superfamily that also includes proteins in the COG4654 cytochrome c551/c552 protein family (M. G. Klotz and A. B. Hooper, unpublished data). In ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, representatives of this protein superfamily (NE0102, Neut2204, and NmulA0344 in the COG4654 protein family; and Noc0751, NE0736, and Neut1650 in the COG2863 protein family) are the key electron carriers that connect the bc1 complex with complex IV as well as NOx-detoxifying reductases (i.e., NirK and NirS) and oxidases (i.e., cytochrome P460 and cytochrome c peroxidase) involved in nitrifier denitrification ([57] and references therein).
S	SH66a	PMID:19197347	All the vent Epsilonproteobacteria as well as S. denitrificans and A. butzleri contain homologs to the second arsenate reductase (GAmH_0397 in N. profundicola).
S	SH68	PMID:18790866	To determine how widely carboxydotrophy was distributed within the genus Thermococcus growing in hydrothermal vents, the presence of the CODH-encoding gene in seven Thermococcus species isolated from a solfataric acid field or hydrothermal vent was investigated. PCR products of CODH were not detected in any of the strains tested (data not shown). It is therefore suggested that CODH is restricted to only a few Thermococcus spp.
S	SH7	PMID:25133584	Genes for the flavoprotein-cytochrome c complex (SoxEF) are present in strain Hiromi 1 and Chromatiaceae species but are absent in Calyptogena clam symbionts and T. crunogena.
S	SH83	PMID:32561582	Though the genomes contain the gene for form II RuBisCo, they do not contain the gene for form I RuBisCo (cbbL). This observation is consistent with findings in other Zetaproteobacteria, for example, strains CP-5, CP-8, EKF-M39, TAG-1, and SV-108 (21, 36, 40).
S	SH85	PMID:32561582	The presence of the alternative respiratory complex III (AC-III) is a common feature in many Zetaproteobacteria and other Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria (36), and it has been hypothesized that they are able to use the AC-III, which is thought to be analogous to the bc1 complex, as well as a molybdopterin oxidoreductase (encoded by the actB gene) to facilitate Fe(II) oxidation (35).
