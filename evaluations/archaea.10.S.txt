S	SA13	PMID:22003381	Genes encoding the stable RNA components of RNaseP or the signal recognition particle (7S RNA) are absent, like in most other Thermoproteaceae
S	SA18	PMID:23160063	Haloarchaeal genomes are known to harbor inteins
S	SA26	PMID:27030530	The most important characteristic of AOA is their possession of archaeal amoA gene, which codes for the α-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonia oxidation. Using amoA as gene marker, recent investigations revealed that AOA occurred with great abundances in sites such as marine environment and acidic soils5,6.
S	SA27	PMID:27030530	Urea was an alternative nitrogen and energy source for some AOA strains such as Nitrososphaera viennensis18, “Ca. Nitrososphaera gargensis”35 and “Ca. Cenarchaeum symbiosum”36, with urease and urea transporter gene identified in their genome (Supplementary Table S3).
S	SA36	PMID:29945179	Most members of the Thermococcales contain genes encoding at least one MBH and one SH (Schut et al.2013).
S	SA48	PMID:20421470	The pathway has two parts: a sequence including two carboxylation reactions transforming acetyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA and a multistep sequence converting succinyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA. Genes identified in the N. maritimus genome coding for key enzymes of the pathway (Fig. S3) include a biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Nmar_0272–0274), methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase and mutase (Nmar_0953, _0954, and _0958), and 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydratase (Nmar_0207). With the exception of one gene (Nmar_1608), all of the genes implicated in the 3-hydroxyproprionate/4-hydrobutyrate pathway for carbon assimilation in N. maritimus are present and show highest similarity to the genes of C. symbiosum
S	SA59	PMID:22247127	Recently, a few enzymes involved in PHA metabolism have been characterized in haloarchaea, such as the PHA synthases (PhaEC) and the PHA-specific acetoacetyl-CoA reductases (PhaB)
S	SA72	PMID:27617060	The Halorubrum lacusprofundi genome sequence is the first established from a cold-adapted haloarchaeon. The genome has features typical of halophilic Archaea, including high G + C-content, large extrachromosomal replicons, and eukaryotic-like DNA replication and transcription genes.
S	SA78	PMID:26383653	Different with Pyrococcus species, Pa. pacificus does not contain “saccharolytic gene island” and “maltose and trehalose degradation gene” (5), which carries a set of genes responsible for the utilization of cellulose, laminarin, agar, maltose, trehalose, and other β-linked polysaccharides. These genes are also absent in Thermococcus species except Thermococcus sibiricus (5).
S	SA79	PMID:26383653	Analysis of the repeated sequences and a search against the IS database revealed that a remarkable feature of the Pa. pacificus genome is the absence of mobile genetic elements including transposons, transposases, integrases and virus-related region. It indicates that Pa. pacificus genome has not been subjected to frequent or recent genomic rearrangements during its evolution.
