\caption{
  Number of rules of expectations in each evalutation
  category (excellent, good, fair, poor, junk) and number
  of missing rules, as well as additional wrong rules
  output by GPT3.5 and GPT4 for each of the datasets
  (H, B, A). The score row contains a score, computed
  as follows: for each excellent 100 points, good 90,
  fair 60, poor 20, junk -10, missing 0, and additional wrong
  -10 points. The average score (last row) is computed
  dividing the score by the number of rules and it is equal
  to the percent of the maximum achievable score (i.e.
  all excellent answers, without additional wrong answers).
