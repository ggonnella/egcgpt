S	S152	PMID:28223374	Despite this, however, blaNMC-A/IMI-type genes have rarely been found outside Enterobacter, which is likely due to their rarity overall, the low likelihood of being mobilized to a plasmid (via insertion sequences), and potential plasmid instability in other genera, as putatively shown for pIMI-5 in E. coli.
S	S155	PMID:18364359	Since then, genome projects of bacteria have predicted that type III PKSs are distributed widely not only in Streptomyces but also other various bacteria.
S	S171	PMID:23671678	In the Octadecabacter genomes, a high mutagenicity is indicated by an unusually large number of pseudogenes (411 in O. arcticus and 361 in O. antarcticus; Table 2).
S	S181	PMID:26305944	In contrast to most other aerobic bacteria, N. defluvii lacks SOD and catalase, and its genome does not code for superoxide reductase either
S	S184	PMID:31666316	IMP-type metallo-β-lactamases are among the most common families of acquired carbapenemases detected from Enterobacteriaceae and have been reported mainly in East Asia, including Japan
S	S42	PMID:22717884	PFAM (protein family) motifs were identified in several of the proteins that are present in the dlt operon of Gram-positive bacteria (Glaser, 1995).
S	S57	PMID:15984913	Only ompB and sca4 are conserved in all available Rickettsia genomes [19], remaining members being degraded or absent in one or more species.
S	S72	PMID:16169927	In the same way, the number of tRNA genes is quite high (106 genes), a feature in common with that in vibrios and in Photobacterium profundum (Table 1). These genes are organized in long runs of repeated sequences. The longest contains 19 tRNA genes in a row, seven of which coding for an identical tRNAglu (TTC anticodon), suggesting a slipped mispair mechanism of expansion in situations of rapid growth.
S	S82	PMID:23749977	Plasmid compatibility of the segmented Borrelia genome involves orthologous sets of proteins, one of which, designated Pfam32, is homologous to ParA, a plasmid partitioning protein found in other bacteria (14–16). Other Borrelia plasmid-encoded proteins of these sets, such as Pfam49, appear to be unique to this genus, are widely distributed on both linear and circular replicons, and presumably are also involved in replication and compatibility.
S	S85	PMID:23749977	The lp54 plasmids bear genes whose expression is regulated during the infectious cycle and that in their respective presence or absence distinguish LD species from RF species. These include OspA (bba15) and OspB (bba16) (69, 70) and DbpA (bba24) and DbpB (bba25) (71). GC skew analysis indicates that the ospAB and dbpAB operons were acquired horizontally by the LD lineage after the putative split from the lineage leading to RF species.
